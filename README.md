## Prebuilt Libs for GoldenDict's MSVC++ 2012 build

### Prerequisites

* Visual Studio 2012 (Express Edition should be OK too).

### Libraries

The libraries are built with the **/MD** switch and that's what GoldenDict build expects.
Some libs are dynamic and some are static, whichever makes more sense.
Both **x86** and **x64** versions are provided.

### Build

Use the following repository to build these libs yourself:
[Tvangeste/goldendict-winlibs](https://github.com/Tvangeste/goldendict-winlibs).
